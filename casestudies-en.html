							<h2>Case Study: From Developer to Manager</h2>
						</header>
                        <p>A software developer came to me feeling stuck in his career. While he had strong technical skills, he recognised that moving into management required more—particularly in communication, confidence, and leadership. He wanted support to break through the plateau and prepare himself for the next step.
                        </p>
                        <p>Together, we focused on building his interpersonal skills, practicing interviews, and refining how he presented his strengths. Using real examples from his past projects, he learned to show where he had already demonstrated leadership qualities, even without an official title. We also worked on his visibility at work, helping him contribute with confidence in meetings and present his ideas clearly to colleagues and senior leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>A big part of our work was developing his communication and presentation skills, alongside practical leadership training. With coaching, he gained the confidence and clarity to position himself for a management role—and ultimately succeeded in making the transition from developer to manager.
